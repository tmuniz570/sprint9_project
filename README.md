# Sprint 9 Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of Sprint 9 and focuses on building a model to predict customer churn for a bank. The goal is to achieve an F1 score greater than 0.59 on the provided dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for the churn dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Evaluation and optimization to achieve the target F1 score.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sprint9_project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sprint9_project
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
4. Check the results to ensure the F1 score exceeds 0.59.
